        <li>1/4 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 and a half cups warm milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup melted and cooled butter</li>

        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, <em>dissolve</em> yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk. 
            Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the warm milk and the melted
             butter. Stir in the yeast mixture, sugar, salt and vanilla. Stir in the remaining
              2 1/2 cups milk alternately with the flour, ending with the flour. Beat the egg 
              whites until they form soft peaks; fold into the batter. Cover the bowl <em>tightly</em> with
               plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until <em>doubled</em> in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the waffle iron. Brush with oil and spoon about 1/2 cup (or as recommended by 
            manufacturer) onto center of iron. Close the lid and bake until it stops steaming 
             and the waffle is golden brown. Serve <strong>immediately</strong> or keep warm in 200 degree oven.</li>
